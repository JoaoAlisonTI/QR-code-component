## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to use the flex display correctly. In fact, I already had in mind how to use it, but what was missing was to use flex-direction: column. This made it easier to position the elements in the code ‚ò∫Ô∏è.


### Continued development

What I realized with this project is that I need to continue working with projects that require responsiveness, I managed to make it a little responsive, however, I will work more with this in future projects üöÄ.
